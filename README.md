# Private Documents Summarizer

An AI-powered summarizer that processes and condenses private document content using **LangChain**, **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, and **LLMs**, ensuring privacy by running everything locally. The app features a simple **Gradio** interface for secure and efficient interaction.


---

## Project Overview

This application allows users to **securely upload and summarize private documents** such as PDFs, DOCX, or text files. It uses **RAG pipelines** with **LangChain** to retrieve relevant content chunks and summarize them using an **LLM**, all executed locally to preserve data confidentiality.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **LangChain** – RAG pipeline + document orchestration
- **Local LLM** – via Hugging Face Transformers or similar
- **Gradio** – Web UI for upload and summary
- **PyMuPDF / pdfminer / docx** – Document parsing
- **FAISS / ChromaDB** – Vector store for retrieval

---

## Features

-  Upload PDF, DOCX, or TXT files  
-  Extract text securely using IDP (Intelligent Document Processing)  
-  Summarize content using Retrieval-Augmented Generation  
-  Runs locally – no cloud API calls  
-  View full summary or selected section summaries  
-  Built with privacy and security in mind

## Workflow Summary

1. Upload a document (PDF/DOCX/TXT)  
2. Extract text using IDP loaders  
3. Embed and store vectors in FAISS or Chroma  
4. Use LangChain’s RAG pipeline to summarize relevant chunks  
5. Display summary on Gradio interface

---

## Why Private?

-  No document data is sent to external servers  
-  All summaries are generated using **local** models  
-  Ideal for handling **confidential or sensitive** corporate documents  

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add document question-answering feature  
- Use better local models like Mistral or Phi-3  
- Streamlit interface as an alternative to Gradio  
- Save summaries and version history
